## Kampar River
Kampar River on the island of Sumatra in Indonesia originates in the mountainous Bukit Barisan of West Sumatra, and empties into the Malacca Strait on the island's eastern coast. It is a well-known river surfing destination because of its tidal bore known as Bono,caused by sea water from a high tide flowing upstream into a wide, shallow, and rapidly narrowing channel against the normal flow of the river water.

## Tributaries
The river is the confluence of two tributaries of almost equal size: Kampar Kanan River (or Right Kampar), and Kampar Kiri River (or Left Kampar). Kampar Kanan River passes through Lima Puluh Kota Regency and Kampar Regency, while Kampar Kiri River passes through Sijunjung Regency, Kuantan Singingi Regency, and Kampar Regency. The tributaries meet in the Langgam subdistrict, Pelalawan Regency, before flowing into the Malacca Strait as the Kampar River.Koto Panjang, an artificial lake upstream of the river, is used to power a hydroelectric generating plant with a capacity of 114 MW.
